## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you'll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.



### 2. Set Up Your API Keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## How to Run

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface

For users who prefer working with command line tools, you can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

Choose one of the following installation methods:

```

#### Running the AI Hedge Fund (with Poetry)
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

#### Running the AI Hedge Fund (with Docker)
```bash
# Navigate to the docker directory first
cd docker

# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA main

# On Windows:

```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama

# With Docker (from docker/ directory):
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main

# On Windows:
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main
```

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning

# With Docker (from docker/ directory):
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main

# On Windows:
run.bat --ticker AAPL, MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 

# With Docker (from docker/ directory):
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 main

# On Windows:

```

### üñ•Ô∏è Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. **This is recommended for most users, especially those who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.**

#### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
cd app && ./run.sh
```

If you get a "permission denied" error, run this first:
```bash
cd app && chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```bash
# Go to /app directory
cd app

# Run the app
\.run.bat
```
